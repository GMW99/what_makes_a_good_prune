# What Makes a Good Prune?
A simple method to determine the optimal amount by which a network can be L1-pruned based on its parameter distribution

Notebook provided demonstrates the method presented in ["What Makes a Good Prune? Maximal Unstructured Pruning for Maximal Cosine Similarity" by G. Mason-Williams and F. Dahlqvist 2024.](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jsvvPVVzwf) on the LeNet5 Architecture with the MNIST dataset.
